When most people discuss AI, they’re usually referring to large language models (LLMs) and related chatbots. That’s how big of an impact generative AI had across industries — as well as everyday people around the world — and healthcare is no exception. [...] Once healthcare organizations are ready to move to the next step of AI implementation, it can be helpful to collaborate with a technology partner that has experience in the realm.
